           <p style="color:red;"> _[in the doorway]_. <p>I found a note from you at home. What does this
            mean?</p>
        
        <p><h4>MRS LINDE.</h4></p>
        <p>It is absolutely necessary that I should have a talk with you.
        </p>
       
        <p><h4>KROGSTAD.</h4></p>
        <p>Really? And is it absolutely necessary that it should be here?</p>

        <p><h4>MRS LINDE.</h4></p>
        <p>It is impossible where I live; there is no private entrance to my
            rooms. Come in; we are quite alone. The maid is asleep, and the Helmers
            are at the dance upstairs.</p>

            <p><h4>KROGSTAD.</h4></p>
            <p style="color: red;">_[coming into the room]_.</p>
            <p>Are the Helmers really at a dance tonight?</p>

            <p><h4>MRS LINDE.</h4></p>
            <p>Yes, why not?</p>

            <p><h4>KROGSTAD.</h4></p>
            <p>Certainlyâ€”why not?</p>

            <p><h4>MRS LINDE.</h4></p>
           <p>Now, Nils, let us have a talk.</p>
