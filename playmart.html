        <h1>Vani Battu acts in play</h1>
        
        <h2>A Doll's House -Henrik Ibsen</h2>
        <p>KROGSTAD.
            _[in the doorway]_. I found a note from you at home. What does this
            mean?
            
            MRS LINDE.
            It is absolutely necessary that I should have a talk with you.
            
            KROGSTAD.
            Really? And is it absolutely necessary that it should be here?
            
            MRS LINDE.
            It is impossible where I live; there is no private entrance to my
            rooms. Come in; we are quite alone. The maid is asleep, and the Helmers
            are at the dance upstairs.
            
            KROGSTAD.
            _[coming into the room]_. Are the Helmers really at a dance tonight?
            
            MRS LINDE.
            Yes, why not?
            
            KROGSTAD.
            Certainly—why not?
            
            MRS LINDE.
            Now, Nils, let us have a talk.
            
            KROGSTAD.
            Can we two have anything to talk about?
            
            MRS LINDE.
            We have a great deal to talk about.
            
            KROGSTAD.
            I shouldn’t have thought so.
            
            MRS LINDE.
            No, you have never properly understood me.
            
            KROGSTAD.
            Was there anything else to understand except what was obvious to all
            the world—a heartless woman jilts a man when a more lucrative chance
            turns up?
            
            MRS LINDE.
            Do you believe I am as absolutely heartless as all that? And do you
            believe that I did it with a light heart?
            
            KROGSTAD.
            Didn’t you?
